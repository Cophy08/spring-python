		<title>DatabaseTemplate</title>
		
		<para>Writing SQL-based programs has a familiar pattern that must be repeated
		over and over. The DatabaseTemplate resolves that by handling the plumbing of
		these operations while leaving you in control of the part that matters the most,
		the SQL.</para>

		<section id="dao-databasetemplate-traditional-sql">
			<title>Traditional Database Query</title>
			
			<para>If you have written a database SELECT statement following Python's
			<ulink url="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/">DB-API 2.0</ulink>,
			it would something like this (MySQL example):</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
conn = MySQL.connection(username="me", password"secret", hostname="localhost", db="springpython")
cursor = conn.cursor()
results = []
try:
    cursor.execute("select title, air_date, episode_number, writer from tv_shows where name = %s", ("Monty Python",))
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        tvShow = TvShow(title=row[0], airDate=row[1], episodeNumber=row[2], writer=row[3])
        results.append(tvShow)
finally:
    try:
        cursor.close()
    except Exception:
        pass
conn.close()
return results
]]></programlisting>

			<para>I know, you don't have to open and close a connection for every query,
			but let's look past that part. In every definition of a SQL query, you must
			create a new cursor, execute against the cursor, loop through the results, and
			most importantly (and easy to forget) <emphasis>close the cursor</emphasis>. Of course you will
			wrap this in a method instead of plugging in this code where ever you need the
			information. But every time you need another query, you have to repeat this dull
			pattern over and over again. The only thing different is the actual SQL code you
			must write and converting it to a list of objects.</para>

			<para>I know there are many object relational mappers (ORMs) out there, but
			sometimes you need something simple and sweet. That is where
			<classname>DatabaseTemplate</classname> comes in.</para>

		<section id="dao-databasetemplate-intro">
			<title>Database Template</title>
			
			<para>The same query above can be written using a <classname>DatabaseTemplate</classname>. The only
			thing you must provide is the SQL and a <classname>RowMapper</classname> to process one row of
			data. The template does the rest.</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
""" The following part only has to be done once."""
from springpython.database.core import *
from springpython.database.factory import *
connectionFactory = MySQLConnectionFactory(username="me", password="secret", hostname="localhost", db="springpython")
dt = DatabaseTemplate(connectionFactory)

class TvShowMapper(RowMapper):
    """This will handle one row of database. It can be reused for many queries if they
       are returning the same columns."""
    def map_row(self, row, metadata=None):
        return TvShow(title=row[0], airDate=row[1], episodeNumber=row[2], writer=row[3])


results = dt.query("select title, air_date, episode_number, writer from tv_shows where name = %s", \
                   ("Monty Python",), TvShowMapper())
]]></programlisting>

			<para>Well, no sign of a cursor anywhere. If you didn't have to worry about opening it,
			you don't have to worry about closing it. I know this is about the same amount of code
			as the traditional example. Where DatabaseTemplate starts to shine is when you want to
			write ten different TV_SHOW queries.</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
results = dt.query("select title, air_date, episode_number, writer from tv_shows where episode_number < %s", \
                   (100,), TvShowMapper())
results = dt.query("select title, air_date, episode_number, writer from tv_shows where upper(title) like %s", \
                   ("%CHEESE%",), TvShowMapper())
results = dt.query("select title, air_date, episode_number, writer from tv_shows where writer in ('Cleese', 'Graham')",
                   rowhandler=TvShowMapper())
]]></programlisting>

			<para>You don't have to reimplement the rowhandler. For these queries, you can focus
			on the SQL you want to write, not the mind-numbing job of managing database cursors.</para>

		</section>

		<section id="dao-convention-over-configuration">
			<title>Mapping rows into objects using convention over configuration</title>

			<para>A powerful feature provided by databases is the ability to look up column names. Spring Python
			harnesses this by providing an out-of-the-box row mapper that will automatically try matching a query
			column name to an class attribute name. This is known as <emphasis>convention over configuration</emphasis>
			because it relieves you of the need to code the <classname>RowMapper</classname> provided you follow the
			convention of naming the attributes of your POPO after query columns. The only requirement
			is that class have a default constructor that doesn't require any arguments.</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
results = dt.query("select title, air_date, episode_number, writer from tv_shows where episode_number < %s", \
                   (100,), SimpleRowMapper(TvShow))
results = dt.query("select title, air_date, episode_number, writer from tv_shows where upper(title) like %s", \
                   ("%CHEESE%",), SimpleRowMapper(TvShow))
results = dt.query("select title, air_date, episode_number, writer from tv_shows where writer in ('Cleese', 'Graham')",
                   rowhandler=SimpleRowMapper(TvShow))
]]></programlisting>

			<note>
				<title>Convention is based on query, not tables</title>

				<para>Query metadata is based on the column names as defined in the query, NOT what is
				in the table. This is important when you use expressions like COUNT(*). These columns should
				be aliased to fit the attribute name.</para>
			</note>

		</section>

		<section id="dao-dictionary-rowmapper">
			<title>Mapping rows into dictionaries</title>

			<para>A convenient alternative to mapping database rows into python objects, it to map them into
			dictionaries. Spring Python offers <classname>DictionaryRowMapper</classname> as an out-of-the-box
			way to query the database, and return a list of dictionary entries, based on the column names of the 
			queries. Using this mapper, you don't have to code a <classname>TvRowMapper</classname> as shown earlier.</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
results = dt.query("select title, air_date, episode_number, writer from tv_shows where episode_number < %s", \
                   (100,), DictionaryRowMapper())
results = dt.query("select title, air_date, episode_number, writer from tv_shows where upper(title) like %s", \
                   ("%CHEESE%",), DictionaryRowMapper())
results = dt.query("select title, air_date, episode_number, writer from tv_shows where writer in ('Cleese', 'Graham')",
                   rowhandler=DictionaryRowMapper())
]]></programlisting>

			<note>
				<title>Dictionary keys are based on query not original tables</title>

				<para>Query metadata is based on the column names as defined in the query, NOT what is
				in the table. This is important when you use expressions like COUNT(*). These columns should
				be aliased in order to generate a useful key in the dictionary.</para>

		<section id="dao-databasetemplate-connectionfactory">
			<title>What is a Connection Factory?</title>

			<para>You may have noticed I didn't make a standard connection in the example above.
			That is because to support <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">
			Dependency Injection</ulink>, I need to setup my credentials in an
			object before making the actual connection. <classname>MySQLConnectionFactory</classname> holds credentials
			specific to the MySQL DB-API, but contains a common function to actually create the
			connection. I don't have to use it myself. <classname>DatabaseTemplate</classname> will use it when necessary
			to create a connection, and then proceed to reuse the connection for subsequent database
			calls.</para>

			<para>That way, I don't manage database connections and cursors directly, but instead
			let Spring Python do the heavy lifting for me.</para>

		</section>
		
		<section id="dao-databasetemplate-DDL">
			<title>Creating/altering tables, databases, and other DDL</title>
			
			<para>Data Definition Language includes the database statements that involve creating
			and altering tables, and so forth. DB-API defines an execute function for this.
			<classname>DatabaseTemplate</classname>
			offers the same. Using the execute() function will pass through your request to a cursor,
			along with the extra exception handler and cursor management.</para>
			
		</section>

		<section id="dao-databasetemplate-sql-injection-attacks">
			<title>SQL Injection Attacks</title>
			
			<para>You may have noticed in the first three example queries I wrote with the
			<classname>DatabaseTemplate</classname>, I embedded a "%s" in the SQL statement. These are
			called <emphasis>binding variables</emphasis>, and they require a tuple argument be included
			after the SQL statement.
			Do <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> include quotes around these variables. The database connection will handle
			that. This style of SQL programming is <emphasis>highly recommended</emphasis> to avoid
			<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection attacks</ulink>.</para>

			<para>For users who are familiar with Java database APIs, the binding variables are
			cited using "?" instead of "%s". To make both parties happy and help pave the way
			for existing Java programmers to use this framework, I have included support for both.
			You can mix-and-match these two binding variable types as you wish, and things will still work.</para>

		<section id="dao-databasetemplate-jdbctemplate">
			<title>Have you used Spring Framework's JdbcTemplate?</title>

			and have used the <ulink url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/1.2.x/api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/JdbcTemplate.html">

			<title>Notes on using SQLServerConnectionFactory</title>
            
            <para>
                <classname>SQLServerConnectionFactory</classname> uses ODBC for connecting
                to SQL Server instances and it expects you to pass the ODBC parameters
                when creating connection factories or when injecting factory
                settings through IoC. The ODBC parameters you provide are directly
                translated into an ODBC connection string.
            </para>
            <para>
                That means that you use the exact ODBC parameters your ODBC provider
                understands and not the standard <emphasis>username</emphasis>,
                <emphasis>password</emphasis>, <emphasis>hostname</emphasis> 
                and <emphasis>db</emphasis> parameters as with other connection
                factories.
            </para>
            <para>
                A simple example will demonstrate this. Here's how you would create
                a <classname>DatabaseTemplate</classname> on Windows
                for running queries against an SQL Server instance.
            </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[

pwd = "cdZS*RQRBdc9a"

            <note>
                <title><classname>SQLServerConnectionFactory</classname> is dictionary driven</title>
                
                <para>Due to <classname>SQLServerConnectionFactory</classname>'s pass-through nature, it is coded to accept a dictionary. 
                For pure python, this means you MUST name the arguments and NOT rely on argument position.</para>
                
                <para>For an XML-based application context, you must populate the argument <methodname>odbc_info</methodname>

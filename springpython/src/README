This is Spring Python, used to build solid, well architected applications.

1. You should also have a LICENSE file in this same directory listing all your
   rights and responsibilities should you decide to use this package.
2. You should also have a COPYRIGHT file in this same directory that cites what products
   were used to build this one, and to satisfy the copyrights of those products by
   giving proper credence to the many developers that helped make this happen.

== BASIS ==

Spring Python is aimed at providing the same well-architected, open source-based solutions
that Spring is offering. Spring's audience is Java. Mine is Python. If you can do it in 
Java, well you certainly should be able to do it in Python!
   
== SETUP ==


== DEVELOPMENT ==

If you want to develop this product, you may have to install some other tools as well.

1. This product was developed using Eclipse (http://eclipse.org). I suggest you download
   and install that.
2. The PyDev Eclipse plugin was used in order to manage python development
   (http://pydev.sourceforge.net/).
3. To run the unit tests, you need to install:
   * pmock (apt-get install python-pmock for ubuntu users)
   * Pyro (apt-get install pyro for ubuntu users)
   * CherryPy (apt-get install python-cherrypy for ubuntu users) (This currently supports version 2, not version 3)
